# Welcome to the Incubator's Lab

The Incubator is the top geneticist of the Ovidians, an alien species who conquer planets through centuries of cerebral methods.

The Ovidians always send the Incubator in first to dilute the respective planets' gene pool to cause controversy, strife, contentment, and any other destructive force that can weaken a planet's population over time.

Here, you can help the Incubator create genetic hybrids who are very cool and want to live life to the fullest. Are you up to the challenge?
